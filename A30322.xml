            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p n="1">I. THe Accuſing the <hi>Church of England</hi> of Want of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> or the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to a <hi>new Teſt,</hi> after ſo fresh a one, with relation to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> argues a high degree of Confidence in him who undertakes it. <hi>She</hi> knew well what were the Doctrines and Practices of thoſe of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> with Relation to <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and yet <hi>She</hi> was ſo true to her <hi>Loyalty,</hi> that <hi>She</hi> shut her eyes on all the Temptations, that ſo juſt a fear could raiſe in her: and <hi>She</hi> ſet her ſelf to ſupport His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Right of <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> with ſo much Zeal, that <hi>She</hi> thereby not only put her ſelf in the power of her Enemies; but <hi>She</hi> has alſo expoſed her ſelf to the Scorn of thoſe who inſult over her in her Misfortune. <hi>She</hi> loſt the Affections even of many of her own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; who thought that her Zeal for an Intereſt, which was then ſo much decry'd, was a little too fervent: and all thoſe who judged ſeverely of the proceedings, thought that the Oppoſition which <hi>She</hi> made to the ſide that then went ſo high, had more Heat than Decency in it. And indeed all this was ſo very Extraordinary, that if <hi>She</hi> was not acted by a principle of Conſcience, <hi>She</hi> could make no Excuſe for her conduct. There appeared ſuch peculiar Marks of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Heartineſs, at every time that the <hi>Duke</hi> was named, whether in Drinking his Health, or upon graver Occaſions, that it ſeemed affected: and when the late <hi>King</hi> himſelf (whoſe Word they took that he was a <hi>Proteſtant</hi>) was ſpoke of but coldly, the very Name of the <hi>Duke</hi> ſet her Children all on fire; this made many conclude, that they were ready to Sacrifice all to him; for indeed their behaviour was inflamed with ſo much Heat, that the greater part of the <hi>Nation</hi> believed they waited for a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to declare themſelves. <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was not a more frequent Subject of the <hi>Sermons</hi> of many, than <hi>Loyalty;</hi> and the <hi>Right of the Succeſſion to the Crown,</hi> the Heat that appeared in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and the Learning that was in their <hi>Books</hi> on theſe Subjects, and the Eloquent Strains that were in their <hi>Addreſses,</hi> were all <hi>Originals;</hi> and made the World conclude, that whatever might be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47923:2"/> laid to their charge, they should never be accuſed of any want of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> at leaſt in this <hi>King's</hi> time, while the remembrance of ſo ſignal a ſervice was ſo fresh. When His <hi>Majeſty</hi> came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> theſe men did ſo entirely depend on the Promiſe that he made, <hi>to maintain the Church of England,</hi> that the doubting of the performance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them the worſt ſort of <hi>Infidelity.</hi> They believed, that in His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> the <hi>Hero,</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> would be too ſtrong for the <hi>Papiſt:</hi> and when any one told them, <hi>How weak a tie the Faith of a Catholick to Hereticks muſt needs be,</hi> they could not hearken to this with any patience; but looked on His <hi>Majeſties Promiſe</hi> as a thing ſo Sacred, that they imploy'd their Intereſt to carry all <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections</hi> of <hi>Parliament-Men,</hi> for thoſe that were recommended by the <hi>Court,</hi> with ſo much Vigour, that it laid them open to much Cenſure. In <hi>Parliament</hi> they moved for no <hi>Lawes</hi> to ſecure their <hi>Religion;</hi> but aſſuring themſelves, that <hi>Honour</hi> was the Kings <hi>Idol,</hi> they laid hold on it, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, that a publick reliance on his <hi>Word,</hi> would give them an Intereſt in his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that was Generous, and more ſuteable to the Nobleneſs of a Princely Nature than any new <hi>Laws</hi> could be: ſo that they acquieſced in it, and gave the <hi>King</hi> a vaſt <hi>Revenue</hi> for Life: In the Rebellion that followed, they shewed with what Zeal they adhered to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> even againſt a Pretender that declared for them. And in the Seſſion of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which came after that, they shewed their diſpoſition to aſſiſt the <hi>King</hi> with new <hi>Supplies;</hi> and were willing to Excuſe and Indemnify all that was paſt; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they deſired with all poſſible Modeſty, that the <hi>Laws</hi> which His <hi>Majeſty</hi> had both <hi>Promiſed,</hi> and at his Coronation had <hi>Sworn</hi> to maintain, might be <hi>executed.</hi> Here is their Crime, which has raiſed all this Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry; They did not move for the Execution of Severe or Penal <hi>Laws,</hi> but were willing to let thoſe ſleep, till it might appear by the behaviour of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> whether they might deſerve that there should be any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation made of them in their Favour. Since that time, our <hi>Church-men</hi> have been conſtant in mixing their Zeal for their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> with a Zeal for <hi>Loyalty</hi> againſt <hi>Rebellion,</hi> becauſe they think theſe two are very well conſiſtent one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. It is true, they have generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed an unwillingneſs to part with the <hi>two Teſts;</hi> becauſe they have no mind to truſt the keeping of their Throats to thoſe who they believe will cut them: and they have ſeen nothing in the conduct of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> either within or without the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to make them grow weary of the <hi>Laws</hi> for their ſakes; and the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of common ſenſe, which makes it ſo hard for them to believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> makes them conclude, that the <hi>Author</hi> of this Paper, and his <hi>Friends,</hi> are no other, than what they <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>know</hi> them to be.</p>
            <p n="2">II. One Inſtance in which the <hi>Church of England</hi> shewed her Submiſſion to the <hi>Court,</hi> was, that as ſoon as the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> had drawn a new Storm upon themſelves, by their medling in the matter of the <hi>Excluſion,</hi> many of her Zealous <hi>Members</hi> went into that Proſecution of them, which the <hi>Court</hi> ſet on foot, with more Heat, than was perhaps either juſtifiable in it ſelf, or reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in thoſe Circumſtances; but how cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable ſoever ſome angry men may be, it is ſomewhat ſtrange to ſee thoſe of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> blame us for it, which has decreed ſuch unrelenting Severities againſt all that differ from her, and has enacted that not only in <hi>Parliaments</hi> but even in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils.</hi> It muſt needs ſound odly to hear the Sons of a <hi>Church,</hi> that muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all <hi>others</hi> as ſoon as it can compaſs it, yet complain of the Exceſſes of <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Impriſonments,</hi> that have been of late among us. But if this Reproach ſeems a little ſtrange when it is in the Mouth of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> it is yet much more provoking, when it comes from any of the <hi>Court.</hi> Were not all the <hi>Orders</hi> for the late <hi>Severity</hi> ſent from thence? Did not the <hi>Judges</hi> in every <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47923:2"/> and the Favourite <hi>Juſtices of Peace</hi> in every Seſſions, imploy all their Eloquence on this <hi>Subject?</hi> The Directions that were given to the <hi>Juſtices</hi> and the <hi>Grand Juries</hi> were all repeated Aggravations of this Matter: and a little <hi>Ordinary Lawyer,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other viſible Merit, but an Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Fury in thoſe Matters, on which he has chiefly valued himſelf, was of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den taken into His <hi>Majeſties</hi> ſpecial Favour, and raiſed up to the <hi>Higheſt Poſts</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi> All theſe things, led ſome of our Obedient <hi>Clergy,</hi> to look on it as a piece of their Duty to the <hi>King,</hi> to encourage that <hi>Severity,</hi> of which the <hi>Court</hi> ſeemed ſo fond, that almoſt all People thought, they had ſet it up for a Maxime, from which they would never depart. I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to excuſe all that has been done of late years: but it is certain, that the moſt cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Severities</hi> have been acted by perſons that were raiſed up to be <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> for that very end: they were <hi>Inſtructed, Truſted,</hi> and <hi>Rewarded</hi> for it, both in the <hi>laſt</hi> and under the <hi>preſent</hi> Reign. <hi>Church-prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> were diſtributed, rather as Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of this devouring Zeal, than of a real Merit; and men of more moderate Tempers were not only ill lookt at, but ill uſed. So that it is in it ſelf very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to throw the load of the late Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour on the <hi>Church of England,</hi> without diſtinction: but it is worſe than in good manners it is fit to call it, if this Reproach comes from the <hi>Court.</hi> And it is ſomewhat unbecoming to ſee that, which was ſet on at one time, diſown'd at another; while yet he that was the <hi>Chief Inſtrument</hi> in it is ſtill in ſo high a <hi>poſt;</hi> and begins now to treat the <hi>Men</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> with the ſame <hi>Brutal Exceſſes,</hi> that he beſtowed ſo lately and ſo liberally on the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> as if his deſign were to render himſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually odious to all Mankind.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Church of England</hi> may juſtly expoſtulate when she is treated as <hi>Seditious,</hi> after she has rendred the higheſt Services to the <hi>Civil Authority,</hi> that any <hi>Church</hi> now on Earth has done: She has beaten down all the Principles of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> with more Force and Learning, than any Body of men has ever yet done; and has run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of enraging her Enemies, and loſing her Friends, even for thoſe, from whom the more learned of her Members knew well what they might expect. And ſince our <hi>Author</hi> likes the figure of a <hi>Snake in ones Boſom</hi> ſo well; I could tell him, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Apologue,</hi> we took up and sheltred an <hi>Intereſt,</hi> that was almoſt Dead, and by that warmth gave it Life, which yet now with the <hi>Snake in the Boſom,</hi> is like to bite us to Death. We do not ſay, we are the <hi>only Church that has Principles of Loyalty;</hi> but this we may ſay, that we are the <hi>Church</hi> in the World that carries them the <hi>higheſt;</hi> as we know a <hi>Church</hi> that of all others ſinks them the <hi>loweſt.</hi> We do not pretend that we are <hi>Inerrable</hi> in this point, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that ſome of our <hi>Clergy</hi> miſcarried in it upon <hi>King Edwards</hi> Death: Yet at the ſame time, others of our Communion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered more ſteadily to their <hi>Loyalty</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> than <hi>She</hi> did to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> that she made to <hi>them.</hi> Upon this Subject our <hi>Author</hi> by his falſe Quotation of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> forces me to ſet the <hi>Reader</hi> right, which if it proves to the diſadvantage of his Cauſe, his Friends may thank him for it. I will not enter into ſo tedious a digreſſion as the juſtifying <hi>Queen Eliſabeths</hi> being Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, and the throwing the <hi>Baſtardy</hi> on <hi>Queen Mary</hi> muſt carry me to; this I will only ſay, that it was made out, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt ſort of <hi>Arguments</hi> uſed by the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> I mean the conſtant Tradition of all Ages, <hi>King Henry the</hi> VIII. marrying with <hi>Queen Katherine,</hi> was <hi>Inceſtuous,</hi> and by Conſequence <hi>Queen Mary</hi> was the <hi>Baſtard,</hi> and <hi>Queen Eliſabeth</hi> was the <hi>Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate iſsue.</hi> But our <hi>Author</hi> not ſatisfied with defaming <hi>Queen Eliſabeth,</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> was no ſooner ſet up by her, <hi>than She enacted thoſe Bloody Cannibal Laws, to Hang, Draw and Quarter the Prieſts of the Living God:</hi> But ſince theſe <hi>Lawes</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47923:3"/> him ſo much, what does he think of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Burning the poor Servants of the Living God,</hi> becauſe they cannot give <hi>Divine Worship</hi> to that which they believe to be only a <hi>Piece of Bread?</hi> The Repreſentation he gives of this part of our Hiſtory, is ſo falſe, that tho' upon <hi>Queen Eliſabeth's</hi> coming to the <hi>Crown,</hi> there were many Complaints exhibited of the Illegal Violences that <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> and other Butchers had committed, yet all theſe were ſtifled, and no <hi>Penal Lawes</hi> were enacted againſt thoſe of that <hi>Religion.</hi> The <hi>Popish Clergy</hi> were indeed turned out; but they were well uſed, and had Penſions aſſigned them; ſo ready was the <hi>Queen</hi> and our <hi>Church</hi> to forgive what was paſt, and to shew all Gentleneſs for the future.

The point which he ſingles out is, <hi>that we have failed in that grateful Return, that we owed His Majeſty for his Promiſe, of Maintaining our</hi> Church <hi>as it is eſtablished by Law; ſince upon that we ought to have repealed the Sanguinary Laws, and the late Impious Teſts: the former being enacted to maintain the Uſurpation of</hi> Queen Eliſabeth; <hi>and the other being contrived to exclude the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King.</hi> We have not failed to pay all the Gratitude and Duty that was poſſible, in return to His <hi>Majeſties Promiſe;</hi> which we have carried ſo far, that we are become the Object even of our Enemies Scorn by it. With all Humility be it ſaid, that if His <hi>Majeſty</hi> had promiſed us a farther De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of his Favour, than that of which the <hi>Law</hi> had aſſured us, it might have been expected, that our return should have been a degree of Obedience beyond that which was required by <hi>Law;</hi> ſo that the return of the Obedience injoyned by <hi>Law,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers a Promiſe of a <hi>Protection</hi> according to <hi>Law:</hi> yet we carried this matter further; for as was ſet forth in the beginning of this <hi>Paper,</hi> we went on in ſo high a pace of Compliance and Confidence, that we drew the cenſures of the whole <hi>Nation</hi> on us: nor could any Jealouſies or Fears give us the leaſt Apprehenſions, till we were ſo hard preſſed in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> that we could be no longer ſilent: The ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> that taught us to <hi>Honour the King,</hi> ſaid like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that we muſt <hi>obey God rather than man.</hi>

But tho our <hi>Author</hi> may hope to Impoſe on an Ignorant <hi>Reader,</hi> who may be apt to believe Implicitly, what he ſays concerning the <hi>Laws</hi> of the laſt Age, yet it was too bold for him to aſſert, that the <hi>Teſts,</hi> which are ſo lately made, were contrived to <hi>exclude</hi> the preſent <hi>King:</hi> when there was not a thought of <hi>Excluſion</hi> many years after the firſt was made, and the <hi>Duke</hi> was excepted out of the <hi>ſecond</hi> by a ſpecial <hi>Proviſo.</hi> But theſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> will do well never to mention the <hi>Excluſion;</hi> for every time that it is named, it will make people call to mind, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that the <hi>Church of England</hi> did in that matter, and that will carry with it a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of <hi>Ingratitude</hi> that needs not be aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated.

Nor would we willingly expoſe His <hi>Majeſty</hi> to the <hi>unwearied Solicitations of a ſort of men,</hi> who, if we may Judge of that which is to come, by that which is paſt, would give him no reſt, if once the reſtraints of <hi>Law</hi> were taken off, but would drive matters to thoſe Extremities, to which we ſee their Natures carry them head-long.</p>

            <p>Of all the <hi>Maximes</hi> in the World, there is none more hurtful to the <hi>Government,</hi> in our preſent Circumſtances, than the ſaying, that the <hi>Kings Promiſes</hi> and the <hi>Peoples Fidelity</hi> ought to be <hi>Reciprocal;</hi> and that a Failure in the one, cuts off the other: for by a very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſequence the <hi>Subject</hi> may likewiſe ſay, that their <hi>Oaths of Allegeance</hi> being foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Aſſurance of His <hi>Majeſties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,</hi> the <hi>One binds</hi> no longer than the <hi>Other</hi> is <hi>obſerved:</hi> and the Inferences that may be drawn from hence will be very terrible, if the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of the ſo much decryed <hi>Church of England,</hi> does not put a ſtop to them.</p>
